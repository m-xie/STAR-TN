# Sequential Thresholding-based Automated Reconstruction of the Trigeminal Nerve (STAR-TN)

STAR-TN is a deterministic algorithm that creates a joint segmentation of the trigeminal nerve and contacting vessels from three-dimensional (3D) constructive interference in steady state (CISS) or fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes.
